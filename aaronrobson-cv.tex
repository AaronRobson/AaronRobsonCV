\section{Personal Statement}
I do my utmost to keep up with developments in the field,
new techniques, libraries and languages;
in order to make better informed technical decisions.
To keep on top of open issues I log them with detailed reproduction steps,
so that myself and my colleagues can hit the ground running in resolving them.

My professional programming experience is primarily in
Python and {\CSharp}.
I have used Python and Haskell heavily outside of work and
I have experimented with Scheme Lisp and Prolog.
I have worked on several personal projects including an implementation of
John Conway's Game of Life and a numeric base converter.

As much as I enjoy programming I am a social person who enjoys catching up with
my colleagues over a meal out.
Outside of work I like going on cruises and cycling holidays.

\section{Professional Development}
I have earned a Professional Scrum Developer I certificate with supporting
training with Donis Marshall
(\href{https://www.scrum.org/donis-marshall}{scrum.org/donis-marshall}), see
\href{https://www.scrum.org/user/282980}{scrum.org/user/282980} and appendix.

Attended the SDD 2017 conference and
DDD (Developer Developer Developer!) East Anglia.
