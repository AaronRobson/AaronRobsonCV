\section{Personal Statement}
I consider myself to be an organised software developer.
I do my utmost to keep up with developments in the field, new techniques, libraries and languages; in order to make more informed decisions.
To keep on top of open issues I log them with detailed reproduction steps, so that myself and my colleagues can hit the ground running in resolving them.

My programming experience is primarily in Python, Delphi, {\CSharp}, SQL, and Haskell though I have experimented with Scheme Lisp and Prolog.
I have worked on several personal projects including an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life and a numeric base converter.

As much as I enjoy programming I am a social person who enjoys catching up with my colleagues over a meal out.
Outside of work I like going on cruises and cycling holidays.
