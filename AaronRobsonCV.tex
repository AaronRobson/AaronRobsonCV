\section{Personal Statement}
I would consider myself as an organised programmer, keeping on top of open issues, logging them with detailed reproduction steps so myself or a colleague can hit the ground running resolving them. I find this optimises the team's work-flow on projects.

I have experience in Python, Delphi, Prolog, SQL, Haskell and typesetting with {\LaTeX}. This has resulted in working on several personal projects including an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life and a numeric base converter.

As much as I enjoy programming I am a social person who enjoys the outdoors and going for a pub lunch with my colleagues. Outside of work I like going on cruises and cycling holidays.
