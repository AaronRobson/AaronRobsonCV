\section{Personal Statement}
I consider myself to be an organised software developer.
I do my utmost to keep up with developments in the field, new techniques, libraries and languages; in order to make more informed decisions.
To keep on top of open issues I log them with detailed reproduction steps, so that myself and my colleagues can hit the ground running in resolving them.

My professional programming experience is primarily in Delphi, {\CSharp} and SQL. I have used Python and Haskell heavily outside of work and I have experimented with Scheme Lisp and Prolog.
I have worked on several personal projects including an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life and a numeric base converter.

I have recently been learning Django from a friend and ex-colleague and while I am by no means an expert at this stage I feel confident with working with models and some basic views.

As much as I enjoy programming I am a social person who enjoys catching up with my colleagues over a meal out.
Outside of work I like going on cruises and cycling holidays.

\section{Professional Development}
I have earned a Professional Scrum Developer I certificate with supporting training with Donis Marshall (\href{https://www.scrum.org/donis-marshall}{scrum.org/donis-marshall}), see \href{https://www.scrum.org/user/282980}{scrum.org/user/282980} and appendix.

Attended the SDD 2017 conference.

Vast experience of meeting customers to discuss future development projects and visiting customer's sites for software maintenance.

I have developed some in-house utilities to improve my own work-flow and to help the development team, these include a log file analyser written in Python and a label format converter from a legacy third party binary format to a new XML representation written in Haskell and designed to be compatible with the newer revision of the flagship product as an upgrade path for customers.
